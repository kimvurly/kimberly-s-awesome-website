I sure do wonder!!!

This is a website that I made to showcase all of my different interests and hobbies! It's designed to look like a blog interface because I wanted the website to seem more personalized and fun rather than professional and serious. I also have my own blog where I talk about my different interests and hobbies, so this project was kind of my attempt at trying to recreate that blog from scratch!

<br>
It took me a while to do the CSS because I am not super experienced with CSS, and I barely even knew what a flexbox was before I started this project. However, I figured it out and I am proud to say that I feel like I improved my CSS skills!! Yay!!

Anyway, there isn't much else to say about a very simple website, so go ahead and check it out!
