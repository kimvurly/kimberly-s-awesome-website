                <h1>exhibit a: buldak obsession</h1>
                <p>
                    kimberly loves to eat buldak. it's one of her defining characteristics to be buldak-obsessed. her favorite flavors are:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>kimchi</li>
                    <li>curry</li>
                    <li>quatro cheese</li>
                    <li>carbonara</li>
                    <li>rose</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    kimberly has been eating buldak for as long as she can remember. it has been probably around 8 years since she first started! kimberly will never stop eating buldak because
                    it is her favorite food ever. it may be super unhealthy and have a questionable amount of sodium, but she will continue to eat it throughout her living days regardless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    here are some images of her buldak!

                <h1>exhibit b: music</h1>
                    <p>
                        kimberly listens to a lot of music. one of her hobbies is literally laying on her bed while listening to music. she listens to a lot of music on repeat, 
                        which is because she likes staying in her comfort zone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        a couple of her favorite artists include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the 1975</li>
                        <li>paramore</li>
                        <li>fleshwater</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        kimberly doesn't have a lot of favorite artists because she switches up her music taste every single month. it is kinda crazy. it's similar to how
                        she changes her hobbies and interests every month as well. however, she's always stayed consistent with coding and math! #womaninstem!!
                    </p>
                <h2>metal</h2>
                    <p>
                        there is a separate subsection for metal because it holds a special place in kimberly's heart. also, kimberly changes her music rotation. a lot.
                        metal is one of the genres that she listens to seasonally, which is why it deserves its own section. she strictly listens to only metal during the 
                        winter. otherwise, she's listening to it while she's stressed or wants a break from the usual rnb and chill songs.
                        that might seem counterintuitive since metal is a bit aggressive, but it helps her release whatever she wants to let out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        also, did you know that people who listen to metal have similar personalities to people who listen to classical music? very cool!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        kimberly didn't listen to metal before and was very into bedroom indie pop. however, she discovered a song called custer by slipknot and...
                        she was terrified. she had never listened to anything as aggressive as that song before. and then she listened to it again...and again...and she was HOOKED.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        she doesn't know a whole lot about the distinction between metal genres. in fact, she doesn't even know if some of the songs she listens to are metal.
                        anyway, here are her top favorite songs that are hopefully metal or else this would be really embarrassing:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>without a whisper by invent animate</li>
                        <li>what was really said by fleshwater</li>
                        <li>linda claire by fleshwater</li>
                        <li>risk by deftones</li>
                        <li>two-way mirror by loathe</li>
                        <li>a sad cartoon by loathe</li>
                        <li>gifted every strength by loathe</li>
                        <li>psychosocial by slipnkot</li>
                        <li>...and of course, the one who started it all, custer by slipknot</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>there's quite a few more so let's just gonna leave it at that...</p>
                <h2>other awesome music</h2>
                    <p>
                        since kimberly doesn't listen to metal all year-long, what else does she listen to?? she listens to a lot of 1975 which i do not know the genre of. she's been listening to
                        mostly the 1975 for the past month. she also likes paramore. here are some of her favorite songs across all genres:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        kimberly found the last song from a tv show and she is incredibly grateful because it is so fricking good. kimberly's rotation of favorite songs changes a lot, so 
                        check back in a while to see if it updates!
