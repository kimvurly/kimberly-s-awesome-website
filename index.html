                <h1>buldak</h1>
                <p>
                    kimberly loves to eat buldak. it's one of her defining characteristics to be buldak-obsessed. her favorite flavors are:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>kimchi</li>
                    <li>curry</li>
                    <li>quatro cheese</li>
                    <li>carbonara</li>
                    <li>rose</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    kimberly has been eating buldak for as long as she can remember. it has been probably around 8 years since she first started! kimberly will never stop eating buldak because
                    it is her favorite food ever. it may be super unhealthy and have a questionable amount of sodium, but she will continue to eat it throughout her living days regardless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    here are some images of her buldak!

                <h1>music</h1>
                    <p>
                        kimberly listens to a lot of music. one of her hobbies is literally laying on her bed while listening to music. she listens to a lot of music on repeat, 
                        which is because she likes staying in her comfort zone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        a couple of her favorite artists include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the 1975</li>
                        <li>paramore</li>
                        <li>fleshwater</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        kimberly doesn't have a lot of favorite artists because she switches up her music taste every single month. it is kinda crazy. it's similar to how
                        she changes her hobbies and interests every month as well. however, she's always stayed consistent with coding and math! #womaninstem!!
                    </p>
                <div class="img_container" id="album_cover">

                <h2>metal</h2>
                    <p>
                        there is a separate subsection for metal because it holds a special place in kimberly's heart. also, kimberly changes her music rotation. a lot.
                        metal is one of the genres that she listens to seasonally, which is why it deserves its own section. she strictly listens to only metal during the 
                        winter. otherwise, she's listening to it while she's stressed or wants a break from the usual rnb and chill songs.
                        that might seem counterintuitive since metal is a bit aggressive, but it helps her release whatever she wants to let out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        also, did you know that people who listen to metal have similar personalities to people who listen to classical music? very cool!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        kimberly didn't listen to metal before and was very into bedroom indie pop. however, she discovered a song called custer by slipknot and...
                        she was terrified. she had never listened to anything as aggressive as that song before. and then she listened to it again...and again...and she was HOOKED.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        she doesn't know a whole lot about the distinction between metal genres. in fact, she doesn't even know if some of the songs she listens to are metal.
                        anyway, here are her top favorite songs that are hopefully metal or else this would be really embarrassing:
                    </p>
                    <div class="music_list">

                    <p>
                        since kimberly doesn't listen to metal all year-long, what else does she listen to?? she listens to a lot of 1975 and has been listening 
                        to mostly the 1975 for the past month. she also likes paramore. here are some of her favorite songs across all genres:
                    </p>
                    <ul>

                <h1>collector kimberly</h1>
                <p>
                    kimberly has always loved collecting things. she had an obsession with crystals for a while (which are still in her bedroom) and pokemon cards.
                    she still has an obsession with stationery, textbooks, and figurines. she stopped buying pokemon cards because she was wasting money 
                    and never got any good cards. however, she still has this app on her ipad to fill her addiction for opening pokemon packs. 
                </p>
                <div class="img_container" id="collector_left">
                    <img src="images/figurines_1.jpg" id="left">
                </div>
                <h2 id="figurines_heading">figurines</h2>
                <p>
                    one of kimberly's biggest collections is her figurine collection. all of kimberly's figurines are somewhere on her desk,
                    which also has shelves. she has probably spent over $200 on all of her figurines. if the cost of gifts were included, it would be over $300.
                    kimberly also really likes peach riot from popmart, and she has 6 figurines. 5 of them are gigi, which is absurd. why is gigi infiltrating
                    her peach riot purchases?? please...all she wants is a frankie figurine for once...just one...
                </p>
                <p>
                    other than peach riot, kimberly also likes to collect other popmart figurines. she has two big bang theory figurines which are howard and leonard.
                    her favorite character is leonard by the way!! kimberly also has 5 molang figurines, and each one was around 20 bucks. that means in total her entire
                    molang collection cost $100. kimberly did not think about this until she wrote this. it is probably time she rethinks where her money goes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    kimberly also has two funko pop figurines. one is of a nerdy hello kitty which she thinks represents her very nicely, and a pokemon that she forgot the name of.
                    she has a lot of random figurines that she bought in vietnam too. a lot of them are sanrio related.
                </p>
                <div class="img_container" id="collector_right">
                    <img src="images/figurines_2.jpg" id="right">
                </div>
                <p>
                    she hopes to buy hirono figurines, but knows that she will probably end up spending another $100 dollars trying to get the ones she wants. it is probably 
                    best if she stops this obession before she goes to college and is in extreme debt.
                </p>
                <h2 id="textbook_heading">textbooks</h2>
                <p>
                    the other biggest collection that kimberly has is her textbooks. kimberly is very curious about a ton of different topics. she feels the need to learn everything and has textbooks on a bunch of 
                    topics that she wants to learn. she buys a lot of her textbooks from the library bookstore since they are really cheap. to give you an 
                    idea of how cheap they are, she recently bought a calculus textbook, written by james steward, for just $2. it was in peak condition and had
                    no creases, marks, anything. it was like it was brand new. AND FOR $2!!!! she also bought a linear algebra textbook this week from the same 
                    library. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    in total, kimberly has around 22 textbooks. topics covered include coding, physics, chemistry, biology, and of course, math. as you can tell,
                    kimberly is quite passionate about math.
                </p>
                <p>
                    kimberly's goal is to finish reading half of her linear algebra textbook and half of her calculus textbook by the end of summer. she will update
                    this website with her progress when school starts. a separate section will be dedicated to all the goals that kimberly wants to achieve by the end 
                    of summer since she is obsessed with goal-planning and organization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    just wanted to say that kimberly struggled a lot with the css part of this. she hates using css and is very inexperienced. she has to search
                    up the tiniest things on google, like how to access a class and id. she may or may not need to take a html and css course over the summer...
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="post" id="cinnamoroll">
                <h1>cinnamoroll</h1>
                <p>
                    in addition to kimberly's collection of many figurines, textbooks, and other silly stuff, kimberly loves to collect cinnamoroll 
                    items. she has tons of cinnamoroll stickers, plushies, keychains (a lot of them), figurines, bandaids, binders, pouches, a floor mat...
                    there's a lot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    kimberly's favorite cinnamoroll item is probably her cinnamoroll binder. as mentioned before, she is obsessed with stationery and buys
                    copious and unnecessary amounts of it. the binder will be put in great use during her junior year when she is taking many classes...sighs...

                    <b>fun fact:</b> kimberly's pfp on the aops community site is cinnamoroll. aops stands for the art of problem solving, which is a company geared towards
                    preparing kids for competition math. the community is full of competition math nerds and kimberly appreciates it a lot, because she doesn't know
                    many people in person who have a passion for math.
